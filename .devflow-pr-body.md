# 🔧 Fix: add functionality to multiply two numbers

## Overview
Added multiply functionality to the calculator application. The implementation follows the existing Strategy pattern architecture, allowing users to multiply two numbers through the CLI interface.

## 📝 Changes Made

### Files Modified
calculator/operations.py, calculator/calculator.py, calculator/__init__.py, app.py

## 🔧 Technical Implementation
1. **calculator/operations.py**: Added a new `Multiply` class that inherits from `Operation` and implements the `execute` method to perform multiplication (a * b).

2. **calculator/calculator.py**: 
   - Imported the new `Multiply` class
   - Registered the multiply operation with key "3" in the `_register_default_operations` method

3. **calculator/__init__.py**: 
   - Added `Multiply` to the imports from operations module
   - Updated `__all__` to export the new `Multiply` class for public API

4. **app.py**: 
   - Updated the header text to include "Multiply" in the list of supported operations
   - Enhanced the symbol mapping logic to handle the multiply operation with "*" symbol
   - Changed from a ternary operator to an if-elif chain for better maintainability and extensibility

## 🧪 Testing Instructions
1. Run the calculator: `python app.py`
2. Select option "3" for Multiply
3. Enter two numbers when prompted
4. Verify the multiplication result is displayed correctly with the "*" symbol
5. Test with various number combinations (positive, negative, decimals) to ensure correct calculation
6. Verify that options 1 (Add) and 2 (Subtract) still work as expected
