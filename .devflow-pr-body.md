# 🔧 Fix: add functionality to square a number

## Overview
Added a new `Square` operation to the calculator application that allows users to square a number. The implementation follows the existing Strategy pattern architecture and integrates seamlessly with the current calculator framework.

## 📝 Changes Made

### Files Modified
calculator/operations.py, calculator/__init__.py, calculator/calculator.py, app.py

## 🔧 Technical Implementation
**Implementation Details:**

1. **New Square Operation Class** (`calculator/operations.py`):
   - Created a new `Square` class that inherits from the `Operation` abstract base class
   - Implements the `execute(a, b)` method to return `a * a` (squares the first parameter)
   - The second parameter is ignored, maintaining compatibility with the existing binary operation interface

2. **Updated Package Exports** (`calculator/__init__.py`):
   - Added `Square` to the imports from `calculator.operations`
   - Added `Square` to the `__all__` list to expose it as part of the public API

3. **Registered Square Operation** (`calculator/calculator.py`):
   - Imported the new `Square` class
   - Registered the Square operation with key "3" in the `_register_default_operations()` method

4. **Updated User Interface** (`app.py`):
   - Updated the header to reflect the new capability: "Simple OOP Calculator (Add, Subtract & Square)"
   - Added conditional logic to handle the Square operation differently from binary operations
   - When Square is selected, the UI only prompts for one number instead of two
   - Displays the result using the mathematical notation `a²` for clarity

**Design Rationale:**
- The Square operation was implemented as a unary operation that fits within the existing binary operation interface by accepting two parameters but only using the first one
- This approach minimizes changes to the core `Calculator` class and maintains backward compatibility
- The UI intelligently detects when Square is selected and adjusts the user interaction accordingly

## 🧪 Testing Instructions
**Testing Steps:**

1. Run the calculator application:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

2. Test the Square operation:
   - Select option "3" from the menu
   - Enter a number (e.g., 5)
   - Verify the result displays correctly (e.g., "Result: 5² = 25")

3. Test with various numbers:
   - Test with positive numbers: 2, 3, 10
   - Test with negative numbers: -3, -5 (should still square correctly)
   - Test with decimals: 2.5, 3.5

4. Verify existing operations still work:
   - Test Add (option 1) with two numbers
   - Test Subtract (option 2) with two numbers
   - Confirm they still function correctly

5. Test edge cases:
   - Test with zero: 0² = 0
   - Test with large numbers: 1000² = 1000000
   - Test with very small decimals: 0.1² = 0.01

## 📋 Additional Notes
The implementation maintains the clean separation of concerns and the Strategy pattern design that was already present in the codebase. Future operations can be added following the same pattern without requiring changes to the core calculator logic.
