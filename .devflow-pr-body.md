# 🔧 Fix: add functionality to multiply two numbers

## Overview
Added multiplication operation to the calculator application. This implementation follows the existing Strategy design pattern used by the Add and Subtract operations, ensuring consistency and maintainability.

## 📝 Changes Made

### Files Modified
calculator/operations.py, calculator/calculator.py, calculator/__init__.py, app.py

## 🔧 Technical Implementation
1. **calculator/operations.py**: Added a new `Multiply` class that inherits from the `Operation` abstract base class and implements the `execute()` method to perform multiplication (a * b).

2. **calculator/calculator.py**: 
   - Imported the new `Multiply` class
   - Registered the Multiply operation with key "3" in the `_register_default_operations()` method

3. **calculator/__init__.py**: 
   - Added `Multiply` to the imports from operations
   - Added `Multiply` to the `__all__` list to expose it as part of the public API

4. **app.py**: 
   - Updated the title to reflect the new multiplication capability
   - Enhanced the symbol mapping logic to handle the multiplication symbol (*) in addition to addition (+) and subtraction (-)

## 🧪 Testing Instructions
1. Run the calculator application: `python app.py`
2. Verify the menu now shows three options:
   - 1. Add
   - 2. Subtract
   - 3. Multiply
3. Test the multiply operation:
   - Select option 3
   - Enter first number: 5
   - Enter second number: 4
   - Verify result displays: "Result: 5.0 * 4.0 = 20.0"
4. Test with various number combinations to ensure correct multiplication
5. Verify existing Add and Subtract operations still work correctly
