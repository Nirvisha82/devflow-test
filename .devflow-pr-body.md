# 🔧 Fix: Add functionality to cube both the input numbers

## Overview
Added a new `Cube` operation to the calculator that cubes both input numbers and returns their sum. This follows the existing Strategy pattern architecture and integrates seamlessly with the calculator's operation system.

## 📝 Changes Made

### Files Modified
calculator/operations.py, calculator/calculator.py, calculator/__init__.py, app.py

## 🔧 Technical Implementation
1. **calculator/operations.py**: Added a new `Cube` class that inherits from `Operation`. The `execute()` method computes `(a ** 3) + (b ** 3)`, cubing both input numbers and returning their sum.

2. **calculator/calculator.py**: Updated to import the new `Cube` class and registered it as operation "3" in the `_register_default_operations()` method.

3. **calculator/__init__.py**: Updated the imports and `__all__` list to export the new `Cube` class, making it part of the public API.

4. **app.py**: Enhanced the symbol display logic to handle the new Cube operation with the "³" (superscript 3) symbol. The display logic now uses a more explicit if-elif structure to map operation names to their symbols, making it easier to add future operations.

## 🧪 Testing Instructions
1. Run the calculator: `python app.py`
2. Select option "3" for the Cube operation
3. Enter two numbers when prompted (e.g., 2 and 3)
4. Verify the result displays correctly as: `Result: 2 ³ 3 = 35` (since 2³ + 3³ = 8 + 27 = 35)
5. Test with various number combinations to ensure the calculation is correct
6. Verify that existing Add (1) and Subtract (2) operations still work correctly

## 📋 Additional Notes
The implementation maintains the existing Strategy pattern design and doesn't require any changes to the core `Calculator` class logic. The new operation is automatically available in the menu and can be selected by users. This demonstrates the extensibility of the architecture - adding new operations is as simple as creating a new Operation subclass and registering it.
