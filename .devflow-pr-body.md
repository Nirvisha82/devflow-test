# 🔧 Fix: Cube

## Overview
Added a new Cube operation that cubes both submitted numbers and returns them both. The implementation follows the existing Strategy pattern architecture and integrates seamlessly with the calculator application.

## 📝 Changes Made

### Files Modified
- calculator/operations.py: Added Cube class that implements the Operation interface to cube both input numbers
- calculator/calculator.py: Imported Cube operation and registered it as option "3" in _register_default_operations()
- calculator/__init__.py: Exported Cube class in the public API
- app.py: Updated UI to handle Cube operation which returns a tuple of two cubed values instead of a single result

## 🔧 Technical Implementation
The Cube operation was implemented as a new class inheriting from the Operation abstract base class. The execute method takes two float parameters and returns a tuple of their cubes (a³, b³). The return type annotation in the Operation base class was updated to Union[float, Tuple[float, float]] to support both single-value operations (Add, Subtract) and tuple-returning operations (Cube). The app.py was enhanced to detect when the Cube operation is selected and format the output appropriately to display both cubed values.

## 🧪 Testing Instructions
1. Run the application: python app.py
2. Select option "3" for Cube
3. Enter two numbers when prompted (e.g., 2 and 3)
4. Verify the output shows both cubed values (e.g., "Result: 2³ = 8, 3³ = 27")
5. Test other operations (Add, Subtract) to ensure they still work correctly

## 📋 Additional Notes
The implementation maintains backward compatibility with existing operations while extending the calculator's functionality. The Strategy pattern allows for easy addition of more operations in the future without modifying the core calculator logic.
