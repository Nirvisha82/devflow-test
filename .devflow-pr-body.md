# 🔧 Fix: Add functionality to cube both the input numbers

## Overview
Added a new `Cube` operation that cubes both input numbers and returns their sum. The cube operation takes two numbers and returns a³ + b³, extending the calculator's functionality while maintaining the existing Strategy pattern architecture.

## 📝 Changes Made

### Files Modified
calculator/operations.py, calculator/__init__.py, calculator/calculator.py, app.py

## 🔧 Technical Implementation
1. **calculator/operations.py**: Added a new `Cube` class that inherits from `Operation` and implements the `execute()` method. The method cubes both input numbers (a³ and b³) and returns their sum.

2. **calculator/__init__.py**: Updated the imports to include the new `Cube` class and added it to the `__all__` list to expose it as part of the public API.

3. **calculator/calculator.py**: Imported the `Cube` class and registered it as operation "3" in the `_register_default_operations()` method.

4. **app.py**: Updated the header text to reflect the new cube functionality and modified the symbol display logic to handle the cube operation (displaying "^3" for cube operations).

The implementation follows the existing Strategy pattern, ensuring that the new operation integrates seamlessly with the calculator's architecture without requiring changes to the core computation logic.

## 🧪 Testing Instructions
1. Run the calculator: `python app.py`
2. Select option "3" for the Cube operation
3. Enter two numbers when prompted
4. Verify the result displays as: `Result: a ^3 b = (a³ + b³)`
5. Test with various number combinations (positive, negative, decimals) to ensure correct calculation
6. Verify existing Add (1) and Subtract (2) operations still work correctly
