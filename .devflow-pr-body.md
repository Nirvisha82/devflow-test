# 🔧 Fix: Cube both the numbers

## Overview
Added functionality to cube both input numbers. This implementation introduces a new `Cube` operation that calculates the sum of the cubes of two input numbers (a³ + b³).

## 📝 Changes Made

### Files Modified
calculator/operations.py, calculator/calculator.py, calculator/__init__.py, app.py

## 🔧 Technical Implementation
1. **calculator/operations.py**: Added a new `Cube` class that inherits from `Operation`. The `execute()` method implements the cube operation by returning `a ** 3 + b ** 3`, which cubes both input numbers and returns their sum.

2. **calculator/calculator.py**: 
   - Imported the new `Cube` class from operations module
   - Registered the `Cube` operation with key "3" in the `_register_default_operations()` method

3. **calculator/__init__.py**: 
   - Added `Cube` to the imports from the operations module
   - Added `Cube` to the `__all__` list to expose it as part of the public API

4. **app.py**: 
   - Enhanced the symbol display logic to handle the Cube operation with the "³" symbol
   - Added special formatting for Cube operation output to display as "{a}³ + {b}³ = {result}"
   - Maintained backward compatibility with existing Add and Subtract operations

## 🧪 Testing Instructions
1. Run the application: `python app.py`
2. At the menu, select option "3" for the Cube operation
3. Enter two numbers when prompted (e.g., 2 and 3)
4. Verify the result displays as "2³ + 3³ = 35" (since 2³ = 8 and 3³ = 27, and 8 + 27 = 35)
5. Test with additional number combinations to verify the cube calculation is correct
6. Verify that existing operations (Add and Subtract) still work correctly
