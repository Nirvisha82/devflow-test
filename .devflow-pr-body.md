# 🔧 Fix: add functionality to multiply two numbers

## Overview
This PR adds multiplication functionality to the calculator application. A new `Multiply` operation class has been implemented following the existing Strategy pattern architecture, allowing users to multiply two numbers through the CLI interface.

## 📝 Changes Made

### Files Modified
calculator/operations.py, calculator/calculator.py, calculator/__init__.py, app.py

## 🔧 Technical Implementation
The implementation follows the established Strategy pattern:

1. **calculator/operations.py**: Added a new `Multiply` class that inherits from the `Operation` abstract base class. It implements the `execute()` method to perform multiplication of two numbers (a * b).

2. **calculator/calculator.py**: 
   - Imported the new `Multiply` class
   - Registered the multiplication operation with key "3" in the `_register_default_operations()` method

3. **calculator/__init__.py**: Updated the package exports to include the new `Multiply` class in the `__all__` list for proper API exposure.

4. **app.py**: 
   - Enhanced the symbol mapping logic to handle the multiply operation with the "*" symbol
   - Updated the welcome message to reflect that the calculator now supports "Add, Subtract & Multiply"
   - Improved the symbol selection logic from a simple ternary operator to a more maintainable if-elif-else structure that can easily accommodate future operations

The implementation maintains backward compatibility and follows the existing code style and patterns.

## 🧪 Testing Instructions
To test the multiplication functionality:

1. Run the calculator: `python app.py`
2. When prompted with options, select "3. Multiply"
3. Enter two numbers when prompted (e.g., 5 and 4)
4. Verify the result displays correctly: "Result: 5.0 * 4.0 = 20.0"

Additional test cases:
- Test with positive numbers: 3 * 7 = 21
- Test with negative numbers: -2 * 5 = -10
- Test with decimal numbers: 2.5 * 4 = 10.0
- Verify that operations 1 (Add) and 2 (Subtract) still work correctly
