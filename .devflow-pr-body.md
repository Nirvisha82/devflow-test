# 🔧 Fix: add functionality to multiply two numbers

## Overview
Added multiplication functionality to the calculator application. The implementation follows the existing Strategy pattern architecture and integrates seamlessly with the current operation system.

## 📝 Changes Made

### Files Modified
calculator/operations.py, calculator/calculator.py, calculator/__init__.py, app.py

## 🔧 Technical Implementation
1. **calculator/operations.py**: Added a new `Multiply` class that inherits from the `Operation` abstract base class. Implements the `execute()` method to perform multiplication of two numbers (a * b).

2. **calculator/calculator.py**: 
   - Imported the new `Multiply` class
   - Registered the Multiply operation with key "3" in the `_register_default_operations()` method

3. **calculator/__init__.py**: Updated the package exports to include the new `Multiply` class in the `__all__` list for proper module visibility.

4. **app.py**: Enhanced the symbol mapping logic to handle the multiplication operation. Changed from a simple ternary operator to an if-elif-else chain to support the new "*" symbol for multiplication operations.

## 🧪 Testing Instructions
1. Run the calculator application: `python app.py`
2. Select option "3" for Multiply from the menu
3. Enter two numbers when prompted
4. Verify the result is the product of the two numbers
5. Example: 5 * 3 should equal 15
6. Test with various numbers including decimals (e.g., 2.5 * 4 = 10.0)
7. Verify the result displays with the correct "*" symbol: "Result: a * b = result"
