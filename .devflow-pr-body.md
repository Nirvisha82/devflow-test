# 🔧 Fix: Add functionality to cube both the input numbers

## Overview
Added a new Cube operation to the calculator that cubes both input numbers and returns their sum. The Cube operation takes two floating-point numbers as input and returns the sum of their cubes (a³ + b³).

## 📝 Changes Made

### Files Modified
calculator/operations.py, calculator/calculator.py, calculator/__init__.py, app.py

## 🔧 Technical Implementation
1. **calculator/operations.py**: Added a new `Cube` class that inherits from `Operation` and implements the `execute` method to compute a³ + b³.

2. **calculator/calculator.py**: 
   - Imported the new `Cube` class
   - Registered the Cube operation with key "3" in the `_register_default_operations` method

3. **calculator/__init__.py**: 
   - Imported and exported the `Cube` class to make it part of the public API

4. **app.py**: 
   - Updated the header to include "Cube" in the calculator description
   - Enhanced the result display logic to handle the Cube operation with proper formatting showing a³ + b³ = result

## 🧪 Testing Instructions
1. Run the application: `python app.py`
2. Select option "3" for Cube operation
3. Enter two numbers when prompted (e.g., 2 and 3)
4. Verify the result displays as: `Result: 2³ + 3³ = 35` (since 2³ = 8 and 3³ = 27, so 8 + 27 = 35)
5. Test with various numbers to ensure the cube calculation is correct
6. Verify that existing Add (option 1) and Subtract (option 2) operations still work correctly
