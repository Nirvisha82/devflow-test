# 🔧 Fix: add functionality to square a number

## Overview
Added Square operation to the calculator application. Users can now square a number using the new "Square" operation (option 3). The implementation follows the existing Strategy pattern and integrates seamlessly with the calculator's architecture.

## 📝 Changes Made

### Files Modified
- calculator/operations.py: Added Square class that implements the Operation interface
- calculator/calculator.py: Imported Square and registered it as operation "3" in _register_default_operations()
- calculator/__init__.py: Exported the new Square class in __all__
- app.py: Updated UI to handle Square operation (single number input) and display result with squared symbol (²)

## 🔧 Technical Implementation
The Square operation was implemented by:
1. Creating a new Square class in operations.py that inherits from Operation
2. Implementing the execute() method to return a * a (squaring the first number)
3. Registering the Square operation with key "3" in the Calculator class
4. Updating the app.py UI to:
   - Only prompt for one number when Square is selected
   - Display the result with the squared symbol (²) for better user experience
   - Updated the header to reflect the new Square functionality

The implementation maintains backward compatibility with existing Add and Subtract operations while following the established Strategy pattern design.

## 🧪 Testing Instructions
1. Run the calculator: `python app.py`
2. Select option "3" for Square
3. Enter a number (e.g., 5)
4. Verify the result displays as "5² = 25"
5. Test with various numbers including:
   - Positive integers (e.g., 3, 10)
   - Negative numbers (e.g., -4 should give 16)
   - Decimal numbers (e.g., 2.5 should give 6.25)
6. Verify existing Add (1) and Subtract (2) operations still work correctly

## 📋 Additional Notes
The Square operation ignores the second number parameter to maintain compatibility with the existing Operation interface that expects two parameters. This is a clean solution that doesn't require modifying the abstract base class or the Calculator's compute method. Future enhancements could include adding a symbol attribute to the Operation class for more flexible display formatting.
