# 🔧 Fix: Add functionality to cube both the input numbers

## Overview
Added a new Cube operation to the calculator that computes the sum of cubes of two input numbers (a³ + b³). The implementation follows the existing Strategy pattern architecture and integrates seamlessly with the current calculator framework.

## 📝 Changes Made

### Files Modified
calculator/operations.py, calculator/calculator.py, calculator/__init__.py, app.py

## 🔧 Technical Implementation
1. **Created Cube Operation Class** (calculator/operations.py):
   - Added a new `Cube` class that inherits from `Operation` ABC
   - Implements the `execute()` method to return `a ** 3 + b ** 3`
   - Sets the operation name to "Cube"

2. **Registered Cube Operation** (calculator/calculator.py):
   - Imported the new `Cube` class
   - Registered it in `_register_default_operations()` with key "3"
   - This makes it available as the third menu option

3. **Updated Package Exports** (calculator/__init__.py):
   - Added `Cube` to the imports from operations module
   - Added `Cube` to the `__all__` list for public API

4. **Enhanced UI Display** (app.py):
   - Updated the calculator title to include "Cube" in the description
   - Added special handling for Cube operation display
   - Shows the formula as "{a}³ + {b}³ = {result}" for clarity
   - Maintained backward compatibility with existing Add and Subtract operations

## 🧪 Testing Instructions
1. Run the calculator: `python app.py`
2. Select option "3" from the menu to choose Cube operation
3. Enter two numbers when prompted (e.g., 2 and 3)
4. Verify the result displays correctly as: "2³ + 3³ = 35" (since 2³=8 and 3³=27, total=35)
5. Test with various number combinations including negative numbers and decimals
6. Verify options 1 (Add) and 2 (Subtract) still work correctly
