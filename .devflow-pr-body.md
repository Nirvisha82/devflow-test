# 🔧 Fix: Add functionality to cube both the input numbers

## Overview
Added a new Cube operation to the calculator that cubes both input numbers and returns their sum. The Cube operation computes a³ + b³ for two input numbers a and b.

## 📝 Changes Made

### Files Modified
calculator/operations.py, calculator/calculator.py, calculator/__init__.py, app.py

## 🔧 Technical Implementation
1. **calculator/operations.py**: Added a new `Cube` class that inherits from `Operation` and implements the `execute()` method to return a³ + b³.

2. **calculator/calculator.py**: 
   - Imported the new `Cube` class
   - Registered the Cube operation with key "3" in the `_register_default_operations()` method

3. **calculator/__init__.py**: Exported the new `Cube` class in the public API via `__all__` list

4. **app.py**: Enhanced the symbol display logic to handle the Cube operation with the "^3" symbol for better user readability

## 🧪 Testing Instructions
1. Run the calculator: `python app.py`
2. Select option "3" for the Cube operation
3. Enter two numbers when prompted
4. Verify the result displays as: `Result: a ^3 b = a³ + b³`
5. Example: For inputs 2 and 3, the result should be 8 + 27 = 35
